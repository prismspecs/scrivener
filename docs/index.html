        <h1>Scrivener</h1>

        <a href="howtoplay.html">Click here for more detailed instructions on how to play.</a>

        <p> Scrivener is a text-based game that takes place on Discord, drawing inspiration from Dungeons &
            Dragons (DnD), Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), and utilizing an AI-assisted storyteller to
            create
            an expansive future-building game. The game is set in a near-future world where illiberalism has gained a
            strong
            foothold, and the last bastions of the left have united to form a DAO to challenge the new world order.
            Players
            from various leftist factions must collaborate to propose and build a new world, responding to crises and
            engaging in prefigurative actions. Players can also propose to change the rules of the game as it
            progresses.
        </p>
        <p> The primary goal of Scrivener is to create an engaging and immersive game that encourages participatory
            governance, collaboration, and future-building. By drawing inspiration from various sources and utilizing an
            AI
            storyteller, the game aims to provide a unique and dynamic experience that fosters critical thinking and
            creative problem-solving. </p>
        <h2>Getting Started</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Join the <a href="https://discord.gg/example">Scrivener Discord server</a> and navigate to the
                #scrivener-rulebook channel to read the game overview and instructions.</li>
            <li>When you join the channel you should be prompted to choose a faction. If you miss that message, simply
                type
                !join to begin. Factions are as follows: Forever Marxists, Progressive Deep State, Anarcho-Syndicalists,
                Beyond-Us Monadists, or Postcapitalist Eschatologists.</li>
            <li>Each player starts with the same number of credits, which can be used to propose and vote on projects
                within
                the game. Successful proposals will earn the proposing player more credits for future proposals and
                projects. Certain projects may also require that players chip in.</li>
            <li>Twice per week, players will be presented with dispatches, which can be crises or opportunities, to
                which
                they must respond.</li>
            <li>Players can propose actions in response to dispatches by spending a portion of their currency. Other
                players
                can then vote on these proposals, with the winning proposal being implemented in the game, therefore
                altering the course of the speculative narrative.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Gameplay</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Collaborate with other players to respond to dispatches and build a new world.</li>
            <li>Use your unique perspective to propose actions and solutions. Factions will provide advice throughout
                the
                game through the use of an AI-assisted storyteller.</li>
            <li>Spend your credits wisely to propose and vote on projects that dethrone the powers that be and create
                space
                for a new imaginary and material reality.</li>
            <li>Be prepared for unexpected crises and opportunities that may arise.</li>
