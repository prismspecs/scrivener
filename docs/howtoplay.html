        <h1>how to play</h1>

        <p>The game takes place on the Discord server, in the #scrivener-game channel.</p>

        <p>To begin, type !join
        </p>
        <img src="images/join.png" alt="">

        <p>To get a list of commands you can type !howto</p>
        <img src="images/howto.png" alt="">

        <p>The game has two complete cycles per week. This means that each Sunday and Wednesday there will be a
            Dispatch, which is either a crisis or an opportunity to which you must respond. This begins the
            <strong>Proposals</strong> phase during which you can make proposals on how to respond. 24 hours later (for
            example, Monday at 6pm CET) will begin the <strong>Voting</strong> phase during which you can vote on the
            proposals which have been made by the players. This lasts for 24 hours until the next day (for ex, Tuesday
            at 6pm CET), when the votes will be tallied and the winning proposal is announced. Hours later, the game
            will make a determination as to what happens in the game world and informs the players. Whatever happens
            will become part of the story moving forward, so any world-changing proposals will be taken into
            consideration; if you take occupy the UN headquarters, this will have repercussions moving forward.
        </p>

        <h2>The schedule operates as follows</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Sunday 6pm CET: crisis/opportunity</li>
            <li>Sunday 6pm CET: Proposals (24 hours)</li>
            <li>Monday 6pm CET: Voting</li>
            <li>Tuesday 6pm CET: Results</li>
            <li>Wednesday 6pm CET: dispatch</li>
            <li>Wednesday 6pm CET: Proposals begin</li>
            <li>Thursday 6pm CET: Voting begins</li>
            <li>Friday 6pm CET: Results</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Dispatches</h2>

        <p>Dispatches are the starting point for each cycle. They are either a crisis or an opportunity. A crisis is a
            negative event that requires a response, such as a natural disaster. It will look like this:</p>

        <img src="images/dispatch.png" alt="">

        <p>Each <strong>Dispatch</strong> is immediately followed by a <strong>Proposals</strong> phase.</p>

        <h2>Proposal phase</h2>

        <p>The <strong>Proposal</strong> phase starts with an image like this:</p>
        <img src="images/proposal-phase.png" alt="">

        <p>During the <strong>Proposal</strong> phase you can type !propose followed by your proposal. For example, if
            you want to
            propose that your faction occupy the UN headquarters, you would type:</p>

        <p>!propose Occupy the UN headquarters</p>

        <img src="images/propose.png" alt="">

        <p>You can also type !proposals to see a list of all the proposals that have been made.</p>

        <p>During the Proposals period you can type !advice to ask your faction for inspiration on what to propose</p>

        <h2>Voting phase</h2>

        <p>This phase begins with an image like this:</p>
