        <h1>How to Play</h1>

        <p>The game takes place on the Discord server, in the #scrivener-game channel.</p>

        <p>To begin, type <span class="command">!join</span></p>
        <img src="images/join.png" alt="Join Command Example">

        <p>For a list of commands, type <span class="command">!howto</span></p>
        <img src="images/howto.png" alt="Howto Command Example">

        <p>The game typically has two complete cycles per week. For example, each Sunday and Wednesday might have a
            <strong>Dispatch</strong>, which is either a crisis or an opportunity that you must respond to. This begins
            the <strong>Proposals</strong> phase, during which you can make proposals on how to respond. 24-48 hours
            later, the <strong>Voting</strong> phase begins, where you can vote on the proposals made by players. After
            another 24-48 hours, the votes are tallied and the winning proposal is announced. The outcome is integrated
            into the ongoing story, impacting future events.
        </p>



        <h2>Dispatches</h2>

        <p>Dispatches are the starting point for each cycle. They can be a crisis or an opportunity, requiring a
            response. For example:</p>
        <img src="images/dispatch.png" alt="Dispatch Example">

        <h2>Proposal Phase</h2>

        <p>The <strong>Proposal</strong> phase begins with an image like this:</p>
        <img src="images/proposal-phase.png" alt="Proposal Phase Example">

        <p>During this phase, type <span class="command">!propose</span> followed by your proposal. For example, to
            propose occupying the UN headquarters, you would type:</p>
        <p><span class="command">!propose Occupy the UN headquarters</span></p>
        <img src="images/propose.png" alt="Propose Command Example">

        <p>To see all proposals, type <span class="command">!proposals</span>. For inspiration, type <span
                class="command">!advice</span>.</p>
        <img src="images/advice.png" alt="Advice Command Example">

        <h2>Voting Phase</h2>

        <p>The <strong>Voting</strong> phase begins with an image like this:</p>
        <img src="images/voting-phase.png" alt="Voting Phase Example">

        <p>During this phase, type <span class="command">!vote</span> to bring up the voting menu.</p>
        <img src="images/vote.jpg" alt="Vote Command Example">

        <p>Voting lasts for 24 hours. After this, the winning proposal is selected and implemented in the game.</p>

        <h2>Results</h2>

        <p>After the voting, the results phase begins with an image like this:</p>
        <img src="images/results.png" alt="Results Example">

        <p>The winning proposal is carried out, and the consequences are integrated into the game story. These changes
            will affect future events and decisions.</p>
        <img src="images/proposal-result.png" alt="Proposal Result Example">

        <h2>Next Cycle</h2>

        <p>The game then cycles again according to the schedule. Another crisis or opportunity will be announced in the
            next <strong>Dispatch</strong>. Have fun!</p>
