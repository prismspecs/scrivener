## Dispatch: Imminent Threats and Strategic Challenges

### Military Exercises and Posturing

**Show of Force:**
<@1239245614634766346> has investigated several recent sightings of military boats positioned off the coast of Sazan. Illiberalist governments are increasing military presence near Sazan and the Mediterranean, signaling an imminent invasion threat. At best, naval blockades and aerial surveillance are likely to isolate and pressure the DAO. At worst, we could face a brutal invasion.

### Cyber Attacks

**Hacking and Disruptions:**
Sophisticated cyber-attacks have disabled DAO communications and surveillance. A massive DDoS attack has disrupted our credit system, forcing a shift to non-credit voting methods. <@930908950998700063> has fashioned a new voting and proposal system which does not require credits from members.

### Legal and Political Actions

**Extradition Requests:**
Hungary has lobbied the EU to issue extradition requests for several DAO members on terrorism charges, including <@689538753038909440>, <@418454167871553537>, and <@619349045306982411>. This legal pressure threatens our leadership and operational stability.

This is the most serious challenge we have faced so far. Perhaps we can leverage some of our existing infrastructure: our moles in corporations and governments, or persistent hacks of the EU surveillance apparatus, Banca di Bologna, etc.
