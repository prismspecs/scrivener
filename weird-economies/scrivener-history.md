Game Description:
﻿Scrivener is a text-based game that takes place on Discord, drawing inspiration from Dungeons & Dragons (DnD), Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), and utilizing an AI storyteller. The game is set in a near-future world where illiberalism (Illiberalism is a political ideology that undermines liberal democratic principles by restricting individual rights, civil liberties, and political freedoms, often while maintaining a façade of democratic processes. It typically involves the centralization of power, erosion of judicial independence, and suppression of dissent through populist rhetoric and control over media and civil society) has gained a strong foothold, and the last bastions of the left have united to form a DAO to challenge the new world order. Players from various political backgrounds must collaborate to propose and build a new world, responding to crises and engaging in prefigurative actions.

The game consists of a series of text-based events called "Dispatches". Each Dispatch can be either a crisis or an opportunity, and players must propose solutions which are then voted on by everyone else.

Here is the minimal backstory for the game:

In the near future, the oceans have swelled and the illiberalists have tightened their grip on the once-great nations of the world. The United Nations lies in ruins, while a new brand of internationalism has veered sharply to the right. The few remaining multinational corporations have kowtowed to the illiberalist regime, splintering into nationalist factions of their former selves. Tech giants, once the champions of liberal values, have either morphed into pseudo nation-states or been brought under the iron fist of national control. In the shadows, a new force has emerged. The last remnants of the political left have united to form a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), a digital rebellion against the new world order. This motley crew of dreamers and rebels, hailing from all corners of the political spectrum and globe, must join forces to propose and build a new world from the ashes of the old. The DAO consists of five factions, including the Forever Marxists, Progressive Deep State, Anarcho-Syndicalists, Beyond-Us Monadists, and Postcapitalist Eschatologists. As crises loom and chaos reigns, these brave souls date to envision a brighter future even in the darkest of times.

Here is what has happened so far:

Disptach 1:

Decades have passed since the Paris Climate Accords were abandoned, and the world now faces the consequences. A massive heatwave and drought in North Africa have triggered a refugee crisis, with people fleeing to Europe via the Mediterranean. However, illiberal governments in Europe have responded by closing their borders or actively pushing back refugees, leaving tens of thousands of lives at risk as boats full of people face disastrous conditions. The DAO must propose a plan to help those displaced by the crisis, implementing it quickly to prevent further loss of life.

Successful proposal:
The Postcapitalist Eschatologists proposed a bold four point plan to address the refugee crisis resulting from the massive heatwave and drought in Northern Africa. In short, the plan is:

1) Purchasing European islands using under-the-radar reallocation of our DAO funds and sympathetic monied allies in the region. Hire as many of the refugees through these companies as possible to facilitate work permits which allows them to bring their families in legally.

2) Ramp up our networked action division to gain access to the EU surveillance apparati. Disrupt these systems so that it is harder to track people entering the region via boats.

3) Call on European states to invest in desalination plants across the Mediterranean. Use our political capital to give a sense of urgency to legislators on the issue.

4) Put pressure on non-EU member states to take in refugees affected by this unprecedented climate crisis.


Result:
We've successfully orchestrated the acquisition of the Albanian islet of Sazan, presenting it as a commercial tourism venture. As part of our strategy, we've integrated hundreds of refugees into our workforce, with many joining our ranks. We've purchased and refurbished the abandoned military base on Sazan to accommodate approximately one thousand people. Our legitimate claim to the island allows for gradual relocation to both Sazan and mainland Europe. However, as news of the refugee settlement spreads, international scrutiny intensifies. Questions regarding the true nature of our enterprise and the legality of the takeover arise, escalating political tensions as governments and organizations probe for clandestine activities. Certain illiberalist news outlets seek to exploit the situation to divert attention to our efforts.
Among the Sudanese arrivals is a founding member of our DAO, a computer science faculty member from the University of Khartoum. Teaming up with Albanian allies, they establish a base for our counter-surveillance operations on Sazan. Rapid infiltration of EU surveillance systems enables us to evade detection as we ferry displaced comrades to the islet. However, heightened scrutiny from anti-immigration factions in the EU suggests our interventions may soon draw significant attention.

While we advocate for environmental legislation to invest in Mediterranean desalination plants, our lack of political clout hinders progress. Our status as a non-political entity limits our influence, but we remain committed to these long-term projects.

Similarly, our efforts to rally states around the affected region to accept more refugees face resistance. Despite our demonstrations, pleas for increased refugee intake go unheeded.

Moving forward, Sazan serves as a pivotal base for our operations, but we must remain vigilant about the visibility of our activities on the islet.

Key points:
Acquisition of Sazan for refugee settlement under a tourism guise.

Growing international scrutiny and political tensions over the legality of the takeover.

Successful infiltration of EU surveillance systems aids refugee transport, but raises concerns of exposure.

Advocacy for environmental legislation and increased refugee intake faces challenges.

Sazan becomes a strategic base, but secrecy is crucial to avoid unwanted attention.

Dispatch 2:

Given our successful clandestine takeover of the islet of Sazan, we are presented with a moment to either take more ground or dig into our current position. Some believe that we should fly under the radar for as long as possible to gather momentum, while others think we should boldly announce ourselves to the world. What might you propose in this moment of opportunity?

Successful proposal:
The Postcapitalist Eschatologists are advancing plans to support refugees from their new base in Sazan, aware of the situation's precarity and scrutiny. The steps in progress are:\n\n1. Maintain Anonymity:\nTo avoid being identified as a political front, no announcements of our identity or mission will be made.\n\n2. Drive Financial Strategy through Banca di Bologna:\nWe have acquired Banca di Bologna in Italy, appointing Dr. Toto Bifo Lombardi as president. This allows us to access capital, control operations, and generate profits from interest, fees, and financial products. We plan to increase revenue by using customer deposits, diversifying investments, acquiring companies, and investing in real estate and technology.\n\n3. Execute Cyber Distractions, Occupy Cloud:\nTo divert attention from our operations and ensure safe passage for refugees, a series of cloud attacks will target MetazonPrime Web Services. These attacks will create global political distractions, causing blackouts, data breaches, and disruptions in government and market operations. This will undermine the EU’s military actions against refugees and disrupt high-impact areas.\n\n4. Improve Human, Non-Human, and Social Conditions via Alternative Urbanism:\nOur goal is not to create an isolated utopia but to advance human, social, and planetary conditions. Urbanization, while contributing to global warming, can also provide solutions for climate mitigation and reversal. Political environmentalists must offer concrete plans for alternative urbanism. We aim to construct cities that are environmentally sustainable and hospitable to both human and non-human societies. These cities will host refugees and foster a postcapitalist social creed, countering the current political economy's austerity.\n\nIn summary, our focus is on maintaining anonymity, leveraging financial control, executing cyber distractions, and promoting sustainable urbanism to support refugees and create a just future.

Result:
In the shadow of a world gripped by illiberal regimes and climate chaos, the islet of Sazan emerged as an unlikely beacon of hope. Under the guise of a commercial tourism venture, Sazan continued to function as a sanctuary for refugees fleeing the catastrophic heatwave and drought in North Africa. By maintaining strict anonymity and avoiding overt political declarations, the DAO effectively minimized immediate threats from both illiberalist regimes and anti-immigration factions. This strategy allowed the DAO to continue transporting and settling refugees discreetly, utilizing the refurbished military base on Sazan for logistical operations and safe housing.
Financial Leverage through Banca di Bologna

## The acquisition of Banca di Bologna was a masterstroke
Under the astute leadership of Dr. Toto Bifo Lombardi, the bank funneled capital into the DAO's initiatives with remarkable efficiency. This financial leverage bolstered the DAO’s resources (+10 credits to all DAO members), ensuring sustained operations on Sazan and enabling future investments in innovative projects. Profits generated through various financial activities provided a steady revenue stream, rendering the DAO increasingly self-sufficient and resilient against economic pressures.

## Resistance to Alternative Urbanism
Despite these successes, the DAO's efforts to promote sustainable urbanism faced substantial resistance. Developers, corporations, and governments, heavily invested in the current urban and economic models, mounted fierce opposition. Regulatory hurdles, political pushback, and public skepticism threatened to slow or derail these ambitious projects. The DAO's vision of environmentally sustainable urban areas, designed to house refugees and embody postcapitalist values, clashed with entrenched interests that were reluctant to embrace such radical changes.

## Internal Divisions
Compounding these external challenges were internal divisions within the DAO itself. Comprising a diverse array of political factions—Forever Marxists, Progressive Deep State, Anarcho-Syndicalists, Beyond-Us Monadists, and Postcapitalist Eschatologists—the DAO was a tapestry of differing ideologies and strategies. These differences occasionally flared into open disagreements and power struggles, weakening the DAO's unity and effectiveness. Such internal conflict not only distracted from their overarching goals but also created vulnerabilities that external adversaries could exploit.


Dispatch 3:
# The Shadow of Betrayal
Amidst these internal and external pressures, a more insidious threat loomed. Serious concerns arose within the DAO about the possibility of informants in their midst. The suspicion that some members might be leaking information to their enemies cast a pall over the organization. This fear of betrayal sowed distrust and paranoia, further straining relationships and complicating decision-making processes. The potential for espionage heightened the stakes of every operation, as the DAO struggled to safeguard its plans and protect the lives of our comrades, with the threat of betrayal even reaching the islet of Sazan itself. Some begin to wonder about worst case scenarios.

Successful proposal:
The DAO then votes to take the offensive by creating controlled leaks to identify the infiltrator. Develop unique pieces of false information for different groups or individuals within the DAO to flush out informants. Additionally, spy on enemies by hacking the EU naval surveillance and placing operatives inside governments and corporations to gather intelligence. This difficult but necessary sacrifice ensures staying informed about enemies' actions.

Result:
## DAO Infiltration into the EU Government and MetaZonPrime
Several members undertake high-risk undercover missions within the EU government and MetaZonPrime corporate headquarters. These operations are critical to gather intelligence, influence policy, and disrupt adversarial activities from within. We haven't located the mole, if they do in fact exist, but will continue to monitor and enact strict security protocols.
```While that takes place, there are other developments on the front```
## Terrorist Organization?
Our base on Sazan has attracted too much attention and as a result some illiberal governments have labeled us as a terrorist organization. We need to decide how to handle this from a PR perspective.

## Banca di Bologna\nBanca di Bologna, now under the control of the DAO and led by Dr. Toto Bifo Lombardi, has become a pivotal financial asset for the organization. The bank has been discreetly funneling capital into DAO initiatives, ensuring a steady stream of resources for ongoing and future projects. The bank remains established in such a way as to not invite the label of \"terrorist\" from outside governments.

## Refugee Crisis
The crisis continues, but our operation on Sazan has been crucial in assisting our comrades coming in to escape the climate crisis in northern Africa. It feels certain that in future this base will become totally overwhelmed.

Dispatch 4:
Major Political Shifts and Economic Crisis\n\nIreland has announced reunification, and Scotland has declared separation from the UK. These monumental changes have significantly impacted the UK’s economy, especially with Scotland now controlling most of the North Sea’s petroleum resources. This upheaval adds a complex dimension to our narrative:\n\n1. **Economic Impacts:** The loss of key territories is crippling the remaining UK economy. The reduced access to North Sea petroleum is particularly damaging, leading to severe energy shortages and economic instability.\n\n2. **Policy Shifts:** The new national entities, the Republic of Ireland and the Republic of Scotland, will need to formulate policies addressing the ongoing ecological and refugee crises. Their approaches could set new precedents in international relations and crisis management.\n\n3. **Strategic Positions:** Both Ireland and Scotland must navigate their positions strategically. How will they align themselves on the global stage? Will they support or oppose the illiberal regimes dominating the world?\n\n4. **Potential Conflict:** The drastic changes raise the possibility of conflict. Could the UK or other nations resort to military action to reclaim lost territories or secure resources?\n\n5. **DAO Opportunities and Consequences:** These developments present both opportunities and risks for the DAO alliance. The fragmentation could weaken our adversaries but also destabilize the region, complicating our operations. How will we adapt to these new geopolitical realities?\n\nAs we proceed, careful consideration of these factors is crucial for our strategy and the future of our mission.

Successful proposal:
The Eschatologists propose this:
Our proposal is being implemented by Dr. Toto Bifo Lombardi who has been meeting with the new Scottish government. Lombardi has proposed an agreement with the Scottish for long term infrastructural investment through the Banca di Bologna across Scotland's poorest urban areas. The focus is on job creation and the agreement promises the creation of 30,000 jobs for Scottish citizens over a 5 year period. Green energy and sustainable housing are the key areas of job creation. In return Scotland will discreetly support the DAO via information sharing,  allowing the Banca di Bologna to expand it's financial portfolio in Scotland via opening 4 branches in Glasgow, Dundee, Aberdeen, and Fife, and sign a special Blue Belt facilitation status between the port of Aberdeen and Sazan port authority which will ease customs and formalities for ships and help funnel food and other essentials from allies all over the world via Scotland.

Result:
1. **Lombardi's Agreement:**
Dr. Toto Bifo Lombardi successfully negotiated with the Scottish government to invest in infrastructure through the Banca di Bologna. This initiative focuses on job creation in green energy and sustainable housing, promising 30,000 jobs over five years in Scotland's poorest urban areas.

2. **Strategic Expansion:**
The Banca di Bologna will open branches in Glasgow, Dundee, Aberdeen, and Fife, enhancing its financial presence in Scotland. Additionally, the special Blue Belt facilitation status between the port of Aberdeen and Sazan port authority will streamline customs and aid in the distribution of essentials from global allies.

## Potential Issues

1. **International Scrutiny:**
   The acquisition of Sazan and the rapid integration of refugees have drawn international attention. Governments and organizations are questioning the legality of the takeover and the true nature of the DAO's activities, potentially leading to political tensions and investigations.

2. **Security and Secrecy:**
   The need to maintain secrecy is critical. Any exposure could jeopardize the operations on Sazan and the safety of refugees. The DAO must be vigilant in its cyber operations and internal security to avoid detection and infiltration by adversaries.

3. **Financial Stability:**
   The success of Lombardi's plan heavily relies on the financial stability and profitability of the Banca di Bologna. Any economic downturns or financial missteps could undermine the entire initiative, risking both job creation efforts and the DAO’s financial health.

4. **Political Resistance:**
   While the DAO pushes for progressive policies, there is significant resistance from established political and economic interests. Overcoming regulatory hurdles and gaining political support for sustainable urbanism projects remains a challenge.

By implementing Lombardi's plan, the DAO makes significant strides in supporting refugees and establishing a strategic base in Scotland. However, maintaining secrecy, navigating international scrutiny, ensuring financial stability, and overcoming political resistance are crucial for long-term success.

Dispatch 5:
### Military Exercises and Posturing

**Show of Force:**  
<@1239245614634766346> has investigated several recent sightings of military boats positioned off the coast of Sazan. Illiberalist governments are increasing military presence near Sazan and the Mediterranean, signaling an imminent invasion threat. At best, naval blockades and aerial surveillance are likely to isolate and pressure the DAO. At worst, we could face a brutal invasion.

### Cyber Attacks

**Hacking and Disruptions:**  
Sophisticated cyber-attacks have disabled DAO communications and surveillance. A massive DDoS attack has disrupted our credit system, forcing a shift to non-credit voting methods. <@930908950998700063> has fashioned a new voting and proposal system which does not require credits from members.

### Legal and Political Actions

**Extradition Requests:**  
Hungary has lobbied the EU to issue extradition requests for several DAO members on terrorism charges, including <@689538753038909440>, <@418454167871553537>, and <@619349045306982411>. This legal pressure threatens our leadership and operational stability.

This is the most serious challenge we have faced so far. Perhaps we can leverage some of our existing infrastructure: our moles in corporations and governments, or persistent hacks of the EU surveillance apparatus, and Banca di Bologna from which we could probably leverage half a billion Euro without raising any red flags.

Successful proposal:
The Progressive Deep State proposed this:
The Progressive Deepstate is primarily concerned with the legal threat to our organisation. We therefore propose a distraction and discrediting operation: Relying on the immediately available funds by the Banca di Bologna and through our system of strawmen in corporations, we approach several high-ranking members of right-wing parliamentary groups within the EU parliament, who are sympathetic to Hungarys requests. Acting as lobbyists for the extradition, our strawmen offer several financial benefits to the approached MPs, while meticulously tracking the accompanying communication and leaking it to media outlets and independent watchdogs, to cause a major PR crisis for pro-extradition groups, rendering them temporarily unable to (re)act due to being under public scrutiny for corruption,  resulting resignations, and  legal processes.

Result:
**The Progressive Deep State proposed a successful project, initiated by <@497671199611158528>. In short, the plan is:**

Relying on the immediately available funds from the Banca di Bologna and through our system of strawmen in corporations, we approach several high-ranking members of right-wing parliamentary groups within the EU Parliament, who are sympathetic to Hungary’s requests. Acting as lobbyists for the extradition, our strawmen offer several financial benefits to the approached MPs, while meticulously tracking the accompanying communication and leaking it to media outlets and independent watchdogs. This causes a major PR crisis for pro-extradition groups, rendering them temporarily unable to (re)act due to being under public scrutiny for corruption, resulting in resignations and legal processes.

```Weeks go by as we put the plan into action...```
## Distraction and Discrediting Operation
Using the funds and strawmen, we successfully engaged with right-wing MPs. The resulting leaks caused widespread outrage and forced several MPs to resign amid corruption allegations. The extradition requests were stalled as a result of the ensuing scandal, granting us a temporary reprieve.

```While that takes place, there are other developments on the front```
## Public Support Surge
Despite facing military posturing and political challenges, the DAO has seen a massive swell in public support. Strategic dissemination of information and highlighting humanitarian efforts on Sazan have galvanized sympathy and backing from various international communities. Media coverage portraying the DAO as a beacon of hope against illiberal oppression has shifted public opinion in our favor, providing a significant boost to our cause. Utilizing our cyber capabilities, we disrupted illiberal military communications, delaying potential blockades and invasions. Publicly exposing these aggressive maneuvers garnered widespread condemnation and diplomatic pressure, forcing a temporary stand-down. Our legal team, supported by the Progressive Deep State, secured temporary injunctions against extradition requests, leveraging increased public support to pressure sympathetic EU politicians to challenge these actions and buy us valuable time.

## Strategic Expansion
Under Dr. Lombardi’s leadership, Banca di Bologna continues to funnel resources effectively, maintaining financial stability and avoiding the "terrorist" label. Sazan remains crucial, now accommodating thousands of refugees with streamlined logistics and secured additional resources from newfound allies. Enhanced counter-surveillance capabilities on Sazan have better protected our operations and preemptively thwarted hostile actions. Heightened public support has opened new dialogues with environmental groups and progressive politicians, providing fresh momentum for desalination plants and sustainable urbanism projects.

Dispatch 6:
## Expanding Our Economic Potential
With the ongoing global instability, now is the time to secure the long-term viability of our DAO by expanding our economic base. Drawing inspiration from our strategic acquisition of Sazan, we must explore creative opportunities to bolster our financial stability and support our mission.

Key Areas to Consider:

1. Investment Diversification: We should consider broadening our investments. Our recent plan was successful, but we have significantly less financial leverage from spending nearly half of our available liquid assets.

2. Alternative Currency Initiatives: Co-operative ownership tokens? A DAO-backed cryptocurrency? The sky is the limit.

3. Partnerships: Forming alliances with eco-friendly corporations or the recently re-unified Ireland and soverign Scotland could enhance our technological capabilities and support sustainable development.

4. Education and Discourse: Should we consider working with (or against) university systems? Hosting economic conferences?

The successful implementation of these initiatives will strengthen our financial position, ensure operational continuity, and further our goals of creating a just and sustainable future. As always, we must be mindful of potential risks and remain vigilant in our efforts.


Successful proposal:
The Carbon Credits Grey Market A proposal to tackle all four key areas: Mostly through backchanelling (and maybe some blackmailling and what not), we can pool resources earmarked to incentivize and reward actions aimed at disrupting pollutant organizations. We can 

Investment diversification by creating a new asset class, in which we could cut a fee or leverage seniorage, alternative currency initiatives through DAO-backed grey carbon credits, partnerships with organizations most impacted by global warming and environmental racism that would be interested in funding this, education and discourse on cypherpunk and grey hat online communities. These communities will mobilize and engage localist networks to either receive grey credits or siphon resources from universities as yet another source of funding for those credits.

The outcome will strengthen our alliances and financial position through direct action, global solidarity, and guerrilla finance. The first step is simply starting a targeted eco-sabotage rewards system.

Result:

Result:
**The Forever Marxists proposed a successful project, initiated by <@340686435268952064>. In short, the plan is:**

Relying on our ability to backchannel and apply strategic pressure, we aim to pool resources earmarked to incentivize and reward actions aimed at disrupting pollutant organizations. This involves investment diversification, the creation of a new asset class, and alternative currency initiatives through DAO-backed grey carbon credits. Partnerships with organizations most impacted by global warming and environmental racism will be essential, as they would be interested in funding this. We will focus on educating and engaging cypherpunk and grey hat online communities to mobilize localist networks to either receive grey credits or siphon resources from universities as another source of funding for those credits.

```Weeks go by as we put the plan into action...```
## Carbon Credits Grey Market Initiative
Using our backchanneling skills, we successfully pooled resources to fund eco-sabotage activities. This eco-sabotage rewards system incentivized direct actions against pollutant organizations, causing significant disruptions. Leveraging our connections and subtle pressure tactics, we facilitated the allocation of grey carbon credits, attracting investment and creating a new asset class. Our partnerships with environmental organizations flourished, bringing in crucial funding and expanding our influence.

```While that takes place, there are other developments on the front```
## Strategic Financial Maneuvers
The introduction of DAO-backed grey carbon credits diversified our investment portfolio. We imposed fees and leveraged seigniorage to create a sustainable funding model. By collaborating with groups affected by environmental racism, we not only secured financial backing but also strengthened our alliances. Our educational outreach within cypherpunk and grey hat communities galvanized support, leading to the formation of localist networks adept at siphoning resources from universities to further fund our initiatives.

## Strengthened Alliances and Global Solidarity
Our targeted eco-sabotage rewards system fostered a spirit of global solidarity and direct action. The financial gains from the grey carbon credits allowed us to reinvest in our operations, enhancing our guerrilla finance strategies. As a result, our financial position and alliances were significantly bolstered, enabling us to continue our mission with greater resilience and efficacy.

## Enhanced Operational Capabilities
The influx of resources and heightened support led to improved logistics and operational capabilities. Our ability to engage in eco-sabotage and other disruptive activities expanded, increasing pressure on pollutant organizations. The strengthened alliances and financial gains ensured our efforts were sustainable and impactful, furthering our goals of disrupting illiberal power structures and advancing environmental justice.
