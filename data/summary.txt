## Chronological Summary of Game Events to Date

**Dispatch 1: North African Refugee Crisis**

- **Crisis:** Heatwave and drought in North Africa trigger a refugee crisis. European governments respond by closing borders and pushing back refugees.
- **Proposal:** Postcapitalist Eschatologists propose a four-point plan:
  1. Purchase European islands to employ refugees.
  2. Infiltrate and disrupt EU surveillance.
  3. Advocate for desalination plants across the Mediterranean.
  4. Pressure non-EU states to accept refugees.
- **Result:** Successful acquisition of the Albanian islet of Sazan. Refugees are integrated into the workforce and housed in a refurbished military base. Increased international scrutiny and political tensions arise. The DAO infiltrates EU surveillance systems, aiding refugee transport. Efforts to advocate for desalination and increased refugee intake face challenges. Sazan becomes a strategic base for the DAO.

**Dispatch 2: Strategic Decisions**

- **Opportunity:** With Sazan established, the DAO debates whether to maintain a low profile or announce their presence.
- **Proposal:** Postcapitalist Eschatologists' plan:
  1. Maintain anonymity.
  2. Leverage Banca di Bologna for financial control.
  3. Execute cyber distractions via cloud attacks on MetazonPrime Web Services.
  4. Promote sustainable urbanism for refugees.
- **Result:** Sazan continues as a sanctuary under strict anonymity. Banca di Bologna provides financial stability (+10 credits to all members). Efforts for sustainable urbanism face resistance. Internal divisions within the DAO weaken unity.

**Dispatch 3: Infiltration and Espionage**

- **Crisis:** Suspicions of informants within the DAO and growing external pressures.
- **Proposal:** Controlled leaks to identify informants, spying on enemies, and hacking EU naval surveillance.
- **Result:** High-risk undercover missions within the EU government and MetaZonPrime. No mole identified, but increased security protocols. Some illiberal governments label the DAO as a terrorist organization. Sazan's operations continue to assist refugees but face the threat of becoming overwhelmed.

**Dispatch 4: Political Upheaval**

- **Crisis:** Ireland announces reunification, and Scotland declares separation from the UK, impacting the UK economy and geopolitics.
- **Proposal:** Lombardi negotiates with the new Scottish government for infrastructural investment through Banca di Bologna, creating 30,000 jobs in green energy and sustainable housing. Agreement includes opening branches in Glasgow, Dundee, Aberdeen, and Fife, and establishing Blue Belt facilitation status between Aberdeen and Sazan.
- **Result:**
  1. **Lombardi's Agreement:** Successful negotiation for job creation and infrastructure investment.
  2. **Strategic Expansion:** New branches in Scotland and streamlined customs via Blue Belt status.
  3. **Potential Issues:**
     - **International Scrutiny:** Questions about the legality of the Sazan takeover and the DAO's activities.
     - **Security and Secrecy:** Critical need to maintain operational secrecy.
     - **Financial Stability:** Reliance on Banca di Bologna's financial health.
     - **Political Resistance:** Challenges from established political and economic interests.

By implementing Lombardi's plan, the DAO supports refugees and establishes a strategic base in Scotland. However, they must navigate international scrutiny, maintain secrecy, ensure financial stability, and overcome political resistance for long-term success.
