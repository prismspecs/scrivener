This period will last for 24 hours (unless otherwise specified), so be sure to submit your proposals before the deadline.\n\n**type !propose [your proposal here]** (without brackets) to propose an action. If your proposal is selected, you earn one ✊.\n\nYour proposal can be as straightforward or as wildly experimental as you'd like. You can even propose to change the rules of the game (within reason). The more creative and innovative your proposal, the more likely it is to capture the imagination of your fellow players and earn their votes. Proposals are limited to one per person per round. If you wish to withdraw your proposal, you can do so with the **!withdraw** command. Once the proposal period has ended, players will then vote.",
