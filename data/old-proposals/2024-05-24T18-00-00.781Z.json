        "text": "[Our proposal is being implemented by Dr. Toto Bifo Lombardi who has been meeting with the new Scottish government. Lombardi has proposed an agreement with the Scottish for long term infrastructural investment through the Banca di Bologna across Scotland's poorest urban areas. The focus is on job creation and the agreement promises the creation of 30,000 jobs for Scottish citizens over a 5 year period. Green energy and sustainable housing are the key areas of job creation. In return Scotland will discreetly support the DAO via information sharing,  allowing the Banca di Bologna to expand it's financial portfolio in Scotland via opening 4 branches in Glasgow, Dundee, Aberdeen, and Fife, and sign a special Blue Belt facilitation status between the port of Aberdeen and Sazan port authority which will ease customs and formalities for ships and help funnel food and other essentials from allies all over the world via Scotland.]",
