        "text": "In the near future, the oceans have swelled and the illiberalists have tightened their grip on the once-great nations of the world. The United Nations lies in ruins, while a new brand of internationalism has veered sharply to the right. The few remaining multinational corporations have kowtowed to the illiberalist regime, splintering into nationalist factions of their former selves. Tech giants, once the champions of liberal values, have either morphed into pseudo nation-states or been brought under the iron fist of national control. In the shadows, a new force has emerged. The last remnants of the political left have united to form a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), a digital rebellion against the new world order. This motley crew of dreamers and rebels, hailing from all corners of the political spectrum and globe, must join forces to propose and build a new world from the ashes of the old. The DAO consists of five factions, including the Forever Marxists, Progressive Deep State, Anarcho-Syndicalists, Beyond-Us Monadists, and Postcapitalist Eschatologists. As crises loom and chaos reigns, these brave souls date to envision a brighter future even in the darkest of times.",

        "text": "Decades have passed since the Paris Climate Accords were abandoned, and the world now faces the consequences. A massive heatwave and drought in North Africa have triggered a refugee crisis, with people fleeing to Europe via the Mediterranean. However, illiberal governments in Europe have responded by closing their borders or actively pushing back refugees, leaving tens of thousands of lives at risk as boats full of people face disastrous conditions. The DAO must propose a plan to help those displaced by the crisis, implementing it quickly to prevent further loss of life.",
