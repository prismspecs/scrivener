        "description": "The immortal science of Marxism-Leninism remains our best hope of resisting the forces of capital which threaten to devour our dignity and the planet itself. Create a communist state by any means necessary to challenge the global order.",
        "advice": "Advice consists of furthering worker-control in all aspects of society. We are not luddites but we must use every opportunity to unmask the myriad forms of class warfare underpinning the decor of technological solutionism. Armed insurrection - in its material and virtual forms - and general strikes are key assets in this toolkit."

        "description": "Our present institutions must remain strong in the face of a very real incipient global fascism. Work to salvage the vestiges of our remaining museums, environmental organizations, and political systems in order to weather the storm.",
        "advice": "Advice consists of bolstering existing systems to create resilience in the face of global fascism. Updating and re-tooling institutions to deal with new crises are the center of this strategy."

        "description": "The state is the problem! Stop trying to fit a round peg into a square hole. Build alternatives, in particular cooperative models.",
        "advice": "Advice consists of rejecting a reactionary response to dispatches/events. Proposes the creation of new systems rather than directly engaging the threat which would be to play on our enemy's terms."

        "description": "The only way we are getting out of this trench is by seeking entirely new scientific and philosophical paradigms, the world will always be multipolar, infuse with more disparate worldviews, they are the key to successful organizing principles that will prod the  autopoietic production of new onto-assemblages.",
        "advice": "Advice consists of experimental and ~out there~ solutions inspired by multi-species relationships, the shared atomic basis of all life and non-life, and new combinations of futurism, environmentalism, and trans-humanism."

        "description": "The end could be near, but not merely as an imminent apocalypse; rather, it is a cyclical climax in our financial temporality. Capitalism, like a lemming, has been blindly circling the cliff's edge, driven by a libidinal economy of leverage that fixates on both the nihilistic repetition of crises and an obsession with apocalyptic finales. We advocate not just for a push over the edge but for an awakening to the patterns that bind us to endless cycles of boom and bust.",
        "advice": "Advice consists of calls to disrupt this temporality that capitalism exploitsâ€”recurrences that seemingly abolish time by endlessly looping it. Intensifying capitalism's contradictions, embracing disruptive technologies, leveraging economic instruments and crises, social unrest, all aim to break these cycles and depart from traditional notions of historical progression, opening pathways to a radically different future."
