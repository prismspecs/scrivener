        "text": "I propose to decentralize our base of Sazan, starting with investing in the extension of our base, on cargo ships stationed in international waters near Sazan. By avoiding regulatory hurdles imposed by the EU, we can increase our capacity to provide refuge for those in need. These ships will serve as a temporary solution until we can influence land-based refugee intake.\n\nSome of these cargo vessels will undergo conversion into agricultural hubs, employing vertical farming techniques such as soilless hydroponics in controlled environments. Utilizing the ships' desalination technology, expert refugees within our movement will contribute to this initiative. This represents the first step involving a crucial shift away from market-driven economies toward a model focused on subsistence, particularly urgent in the face of the climate crisis.\n\nWe will redirect the talents of some of our coders, software engineers, and cybersecurity specialists towards infiltrating and influencing legislative bodies in both EU and non-EU countries. By introducing amendments and creating faux legislation that serves our interests, we aim to overwhelm and disrupt their systems.\n\nSimultaneously, our AI bots will target illiberalist media outlets, disseminating curated content to expose the culpability of politicians, business leaders, and corporations in exacerbating the ongoing catastrophe. These interventions will conclude with the display of our faction's logo and agenda, signaling our presence and mission to the world.",
