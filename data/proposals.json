        "text": "I propose to decentralize our base of Sazan, starting with investing in the extension of our base, on cargo ships stationed in international waters near Sazan. By avoiding regulatory hurdles imposed by the EU, we can increase our capacity to provide refuge for those in need. These ships will serve as a temporary solution until we can influence land-based refugee intake.\n\nSome of these cargo vessels will undergo conversion into agricultural hubs, employing vertical farming techniques such as soilless hydroponics in controlled environments. Utilizing the ships' desalination technology, expert refugees within our movement will contribute to this initiative. This represents the first step involving a crucial shift away from market-driven economies toward a model focused on subsistence, particularly urgent in the face of the climate crisis.\n\nWe will redirect the talents of some of our coders, software engineers, and cybersecurity specialists towards infiltrating and influencing legislative bodies in both EU and non-EU countries. By introducing amendments and creating faux legislation that serves our interests, we aim to overwhelm and disrupt their systems.\n\nSimultaneously, our AI bots will target illiberalist media outlets, disseminating curated content to expose the culpability of politicians, business leaders, and corporations in exacerbating the ongoing catastrophe. These interventions will conclude with the display of our faction's logo and agenda, signaling our presence and mission to the world.",

        "text": "The Postcapitalist Eschatologists are advancing plans to support refugees from their new base in Sazan, aware of the situation's precarity and scrutiny. The steps in progress are:\n\n1. Maintain Anonymity:\nTo avoid being identified as a political front, no announcements of our identity or mission will be made.\n\n2. Drive Financial Strategy through Banca di Bologna:\nWe have acquired Banca di Bologna in Italy, appointing Dr. Toto Bifo Lombardi as president. This allows us to access capital, control operations, and generate profits from interest, fees, and financial products. We plan to increase revenue by using customer deposits, diversifying investments, acquiring companies, and investing in real estate and technology.\n\n3. Execute Cyber Distractions, Occupy Cloud:\nTo divert attention from our operations and ensure safe passage for refugees, a series of cloud attacks will target MetazonPrime Web Services. These attacks will create global political distractions, causing blackouts, data breaches, and disruptions in government and market operations. This will undermine the EUâ€™s military actions against refugees and disrupt high-impact areas.\n\n4. Improve Human, Non-Human, and Social Conditions via Alternative Urbanism:\nOur goal is not to create an isolated utopia but to advance human, social, and planetary conditions. Urbanization, while contributing to global warming, can also provide solutions for climate mitigation and reversal. Political environmentalists must offer concrete plans for alternative urbanism. We aim to construct cities that are environmentally sustainable and hospitable to both human and non-human societies. These cities will host refugees and foster a postcapitalist social creed, countering the current political economy's austerity.\n\nIn summary, our focus is on maintaining anonymity, leveraging financial control, executing cyber distractions, and promoting sustainable urbanism to support refugees and create a just future.",

        "text": "We propose a careful but directed approach to expending our presence and influence on Sazan. \nFirst, we will use our wide network among European governments to engage in covert diplomatic efforts with fellow progressive orgs and states to secure our political position. Within this step, we will also attempt to involve large-scale companies and activist funds with progressive objectives, to tie our presence on Sazan to global capital, providing us with a more secure economic position and allowing us to continue our work. For this, presenting our org as a private fund-based humanitarian NGO, rather than a movement with large-scale political goals is crucial. People should know, that our objective is enabling crisis support in the region. They should not know our larger objectives and network for now.\nSecond, we will slowly extend our public presence both within the local communities and European media, primarily emphasizing our deep commitment to the continuation and extension of our humanitarian work and offer the support and resources of the Progressive Deep State to federal actors and affected communities for further crisis support and prevention. We will position ourselves not as an alternative to the existing systems, but rather as financial and political enablers.\nThird, we will actively work on disengaging illiberalist media coverage on both the climate event and the suspected takeover of Sazan through covert financial investment into the corresponding media houses, gaining control over the discourse and establishing reporting in line with our larger objectives. This also includes media houses in countries with political objectives contrary to ours, to affect the political discourse and turn the tables in favor of our important and necessary humanitarian work.",
